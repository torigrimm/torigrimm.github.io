##Getting Started With Bootstrap

Bootstrap is easy and great! It provides many useful features, including:
* 12 Column Grid System
* Buttons
* Basic Javascript

Lots of important sites use bootstrap as part of their stying. Using bootstrap lets you get basic style issues taken care of so you can move on to making a really unique site.

To learn more about the bootstrap navbar classes (used in this layout), see the [navbar documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar)

This is also a markdown demo, btw.
