<h1><b>Have 4 Minutes? Then You Can Do This 30-Day HIIT Challenge? - </b></h1>
<p2>The holidays usually mean two things: eating more and exercising less. But don't worry, I'm not going to tell you to give up sugar and start training for a maraton (unless that's your thang, of course). Instead, commit to short bursts of exercise each day to (a) blast calories and (b) stay motivated "This challenge is designed to work your entire body over the course of a week, while making it easy to fit exercise into your schedule," says Amanda Butler, trainer at the Fhitting Room in New York City (a studi dedicated to HIIT), who created the plan. "I'm not asking for more than four minutes a day, but once you get started, it'll be hard to stop." Trust.</P2>
